# pizza-hunt

## Description
Pizza is a social food. Pizza parties and sharing a pie. Well this app takes it a step further. Create your favorite pizza recipe and share it with the community. Then members of the
community can interact with your recipes and you can communicate with one another. So if you have a unique spin on a Meat Lovers pizza or an otherworldly concoction of your own,
you can get other people's feedback and your brilliance can be shared.
